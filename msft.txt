all right you guys my 15-year-old daughter has built an Instagram account that has gained over 26,000 followers in just over 3 months because of one thing Vision she has Vision she was able to complete that extremely fast today I'm going to talk about my vision for rafiti I want you guys to understand like where I'm going with this company where I'm going with this channel what I see uh how much money we want to be bringing in ultimately this is for you I want you guys to take what I'm telling you incorporate it into your lives into your businesses so that way you can take things from where you're at right now five six figures up to seven 8 nine figures and if you don't think that that's possible then you need to just turn this video off right now and just go go watch something that's going to help you feel better about being placed in the box that you're living in right now because literally if you want anything better in life you have to dream it you have to see yourself having it and if you do that then literally the guy is a limit you think that you're different than Elon Musk you think that you're different than Mark Cuban you think you're different than any professional athlete you're not we all bleed red it's just a matter of what Vision we have in our head what we tell ourselves the stories that we say to ourselves how much we allow our past to impact our worthiness and if you tell yourself the right things you can have anything in the world so that's what I'm going to talk about today so I'm going to tell you about my daughter here in just a minute and how she was able to accomplish this and and the vision that she set for herself at 15 and then I'm going to tell you about the rafiti vision but I want to talk you guys I've got a I've got a napkin here with some notes on it cuz I don't have my my computer in front of me obviously by the way I'm in Wyoming right now I got to show you this you guys I had to Fashion a tripod out of sticks look at this this is my tripod isn't that awesome okay why is Vision so important if we don't set our sights on something that we want that we desire and take action towards it then we stay stuck the only way that you can overcome what you have right now the the box that you're put in is to think outside of that box that is casting a vision now don't get this confused with goals we've got this guy in our coaching group his name is Chad he did a video last week on goal setting and he was kind of had like a little bit of a contrarian perspective which I appreciate it I like and and I'm the same way I don't set goals because a goal is it's something that you want and it's just it's just something that you want I want to lose 10 lound I want an extra $110,000 in the bank I want to take a vacation I'm setting a goal to take a vacation next year I'm setting a goal to lose 10bs it's just a want it's not a desire and they're generally accomplished just by external work whereas a vision is becoming in line with who you are meant to become who you believe you are meant to become now again like this is mindset stuff and I know a lot of you guys are like hey I just want tactical give me tactical I'm going to give you tactical here in just a minute I don't want you to Discount the importance of mindset you know what's funny is uh I've talked to a number of people who have created mindset courses and they talk about the importance of transforming your mind and most people when they hear mindset they get this like they put up a wall they're like I don't I don't care about any of that stuff just tell me how to make $100,000 but when they change those courses to how to make $100,000 they don't have to change anything in in the middle they don't have to change any of their mindset content they don't have to change anything in the course that talks about mindset they just change the label of the course from how to have a better mindset to how to make $100,000 a month they'll get a hundred times more people interested in how to make $100,000 a month as opposed to mindset but it's the exact same lessons mindset is everything it's everything because if you don't have a belief in something if you don't believe it why would you ever Chase it and if you don't chase it how are you ever going to obtain it it's all right here now I'm sure I've lost some of you guys there but that's okay because the people who are watching this right now you're the ones who are going to change you're the ones who are are going to experience a shift all right let's see what else here okay vision is not just external work vision is internal work you hear it every year right you guys like every December people are like yeah January 1st I'm going I'm going to chase my weight loss goals I'm going to lose 10 lbs and then they they get to work and they they work really hard on it but what happens in February those people stop they stop working out out they get back into their old habits their old routines they start drinking on the weekends with their buddies because they didn't have a vision they set a goal they didn't see themselves actually being the person who was 10 lb lighter they wanted to check a box they didn't actually see themselves as the person who was thin who was fit they didn't see themselves as the person who is wealthy because you're only willing to go so far when you have a vision you're willing to do whatever it takes and I know you guys have heard me talk about this before I talked about a few videos back I did the video a few days ago about my house and how we were able to get that house we created a vision we saw ourselves as people who are worthy enough to live in a house that big that nice that that amazing with a pool of 5 Acres goats you saw my goats my neighbors goats they My Goats we set a vision for ourselves and we went after it and we accomplished it that's who we are inside the vision created a picture of who we are inside it created a picture of who we knew we were all along I hope this resonates if it resonates leave it resonates in the comments please a goal is something that you want a vision is who you know you can become okay four steps to creating a vision and it doesn't matter what the vision is like my vision is like and I'm going to share it in a minute I don't want to I don't want to get too far ahead step number one is think about what you want think about who you want to be is it wealthy do you want $10 million in the bank do you want to live in a mansion do you want to drive a nice car do you want to have a creek going by you like this right here what is it that you want step two write it down in as much detail as you possibly can think of write it down make it pages long this is where we lose people cuz most people don't want to put in this level of effort write it down as if you already have it express your gratitude for living the life that you want step three open your mind to circumstances and opportunities that present themselves that will get you closer to that Vision remember you're learning to rethink you have to completely reprogram the way you think step four act as though you've already obtained it feel what it feels like emote have that emotion somebody just messaged me today left a comment on one of my videos where I said you got to remove the money emotion right you have to take emotion out of it he was a little bit confused with it cuz he's like no emotion is how we have relationships you can't remove emotion like yeah I'm not telling you remove emotion completely I'm not telling you to be a a robot I'm telling you you have to unlink the negative emotion that you have towards money if you want to make more money in reality emotion is how you explode things emotion is how you get where you want to go if you didn't have emotion you didn't have desire you'd never get where you wanted to go emotion is everything feel it okay I'm going to tell you tell you two visions oh man this rock is hard and cold my butt is hurting okay my daughter's vision and I'm going to check with her before I post this make sure she's okay with it but I think she will be cuz she's let me post stuff about her journey before my daughter's Vision she wants to be on Broadway she's wanted to be on Broadway since she was a little girl she would sing all of the show tun she loves it so much and I know some of you guys probably not into that it's totally fine it's her vision not yours she wants to be on Broadway and um she's like Dad how can I be on Broadway I was like Hey kid you can go in the front door with everybody else you can go audition move to New York go audition try for years and years and years 1% of people get in the rest of them fail the ones who stick with it are the ones who will make it she's like okay I'm willing to do that like okay I was like or you can create a social media following to where the decision makers notice you you build relationships with people who are the ones who are ultimately going to make decisions you build friendships with people who have pull on Broadway and then you go through the back door she's like I like that better and so she went all in created this insane fast-paced incredible Instagram account called Broadway Diaries I'm not shouting her out so you guys can go follow her and she
