video which could even be on there it's not is it on there there it is so let's go on 1 m.video hide all the password so you guys can't see what I'm doing let's go straight to the home screen so you can't see people's details load more which I don't know why they've added that but they have get Rob's one up this is the streaming platform by the way guys what you're going to see this is where we were stand that's robs has he won't mind me saying this that's me in the background see if I can pause it at the right moment he Act is Rob by the way it's ridiculous okay so we could probably get an angle here so you you can see how nice the house is on the inside but I try and find something all right so what I've done because I couldn't actually find the moment in the video I've brought the pictures up on screen of Rob's place and I I don't think you'll mind because they're in the video um he's posted them on his own Instagram as well which is probably the best place to find some of these images um but you can see like I I don't think it's a security risk either because you have just no idea where it is but you can see like what a beautiful life that he set up what great house that he's got and I won't tell you figures although I did I do think he said it in the video but I won't tell you figures cuz I don't think that's fair um and it's not cheap but it's something that I think every guy watching this could afford eventually you know could save up to affords like it's not Millions so I think it's something that everybody could do it's something that I'm planning to do this year and have that as an asset in my life um it's it's it's not going to break it's it's a lot of money I don't want to become naive to that but it's not going to kill you it's not going to break the bank do you know what I mean it's something that I think you don't have to pay off in one go either like you just have to half if you're a foreign citizen is it's not easy but it's doable for most guys you know especially if you get your sorted and get your head down all right so the camera went off again I just you know what it is I need to get a bigger memory stick recording in um recording in 4k just eats the SD cards so what we're looking at here is we've got let's go back to where we were so like I was saying with Rob's place is doable it is doable and you don't even have to spend that much you know but it is doable for a lot of people and it just it just comes from not being that guy who's going to get let me grab my phone comes from it comes from being the guy who isn't going to get a mortgage and have kids by like 27 isn't going to get married instead you put your money into something like a holiday home right and if you were to do that suddenly as you can see here just from being in between 25 and 45 not drinking and having a holiday home you're in the top 1.2% uh 1.26% of men between those ages like immediately just immediately from those three things you've got a holiday home you don't drink and you're between 25 and 45 just based on that criteria there's almost like out of a 100 guys there's like one pretty much there might be one there might be two depending on the group that actually have the same setup as you okay now on top of that if you just have a skincare routine suddenly you're in the top 0.5% of men so out of every hundred men that criteria alone there's going to be maybe one of you in a in a group of a hundred there might be one of you out of 200 there's always going to be one guy that does what you do that's pretty good  odds do you know what I mean like it's not hard to become a top percentile individual like this is why 30 to 50 is just a percentages game it's it's really not that difficult guys I've got another one for you I should have made way more of these to be fair but I've got another one here so we start again me between 25 and 45 you can do these yourself as well guys do you know just create one of these and just go and find the percentages or like rough percentages and start dividing it down it's not it's really not that difficult to do and it it just gives you hope like this one here is going to give you massive hope so men between 25 and 45 obviously that's 100% that's all the guys obviously within that bracket that don't have kids is about 50% okay so it's just because the guys that are younger don't have the kids the guys that are older 10 to do um so if you let's say got to 30 and you didn't have kids you're in kind of you that that one is more based on attraction and money truth be told because you're going to have more money if you don't have kids and you're going to appear more attractive to a wider range of women um so yeah that one actually is it's not to say you should never have kids that's what people say like Jordan Peterson says and it's like no I know I agree but I just don't think right away I think You' got your own life to live um if you're just in shape during those ages uh because here's the thing the I saw statistics that said 133% of men believe that they're in shape now let's just slash 3% of that because a lot of guys think they're in shape but they're not um so I would I I've done a rough estimate of around about 10% so 10% of the 50 is five so suddenly if you're in shape and you don't have kids and you're between 25 and 45 which is very easy to do you only really have to do one thing you're going to be within those ages on your own don't have kids is very easy to do and then suddenly you just go and get in shape which is like the harder one to do but if that's all you got focus on you're you're in the top 5% for that bracket um and then if you can become wealthy which is probably anything above probably anything above like 70 80,000 a year I think probably separates you from the pack because that's like a 10% thing um yeah that would put you at 0.5 but I think anything 100 Grand and above puts you at like 0.1 with that whole category with all of that combined so if you're let's say you're 30 years old you don't have kids you're in shape and you make 100 Grand a year which I think is doable for a lot of guys well I I think it's doable for everyone as long as you don't have something really holding you back you know like you don't have an IQ of like 70 or some or you don't live somewhere where there's just no jobs but I think it's doable for pretty much everyone to have this setup well then you're in the top 0.1% do you see what I mean guys it's not that difficult it really isn't that difficult and you can you can do thousands of these okay and this is just a scale of four and like just using four categories I've been able to put a man on the moon I've been able to put a man in the top 0.1% of men within that age bracket which is probably the most important bracket in a male life 0.1% you know you add in skincare that comes down by a third like you basically what I'm telling you is you just become one in a million like it's it's it is doable if you can just do multiple things all at once I've I think I've told you guys before about the VIN score Vin is not a Welsh man Vin stands for four different things which is value Rarity anonimity and nons substitutional and it was used by people like Warren Buffett to gauge how much money somebody would earn based on their score out of 10 on each of those things now if you score 40 you're probably a billionaire if you scored four you probably work at McDonald's and it's because like how much value are you providing okay and it can be used for this too like how much value are you providing to the world like how much do you offer you have a holiday home wow like you're wealthy you're in shape you have a ton of lot of things to offer you you know you your life setup is amazing like this is what puts you at a 10 in that area Rarity what I showed you a minute ago in shape 5% it's roughly 10% of men but that's pretty rare holiday home was like 3% of people and a good holiday home in a nice location not a caravan in TBI right that puts you up to you know like some you Americans might know could be like a small condo in I I I don't really know but like tamper something like that do you know what I mean like one of those like retirement villages for old people like that doesn't count in my opinion it's got to be something decent it probably puts you in the top like one or two% immediately for like Rarity for having fun going on uh and being in shape is the same thing do you know what I mean makes you super rare and then the next one is imity how long does it take to actually get those things or get in shape and whatever become wealthy well that might be like 10 15 20 years so if you've put the work in from like 18 years old and by the time you get to let's say by the time you even get to like my age now 31 you have all that in place like it's hard for somebody else to then replicate which makes you even more rare and valuable and then non-s substitutional is like how many other people can do what you do how many other people can can copy it we'll get in shape that you know that can be copied it's there's no restrictions apart from laziness okay so that's not that rare in terms of non-s substitutional but something like you don't have kids somebody who does have kids can't get rid of them so that's a nogo so immediately that put you on a higher ranking do you see what I mean and if you were to add it all up on the VIN scho you would see where you ranked I might do a separate video on that too um but this is pretty much once you get to 30 to 50 like what life is all about and a few years before too probably 28 onwards uh but it just looks better 30 to 50 but it's not that hard guys it really isn't that hard to put yourself in a top percentile you know especially collectively once you add up a few things and that's why I've done a scale of four to show you guys how easy it really is now I'm just going to go through a few more notes that I've made and um one of the biggest filters for men is resisting the urge to get somebody pregnant and marry the first Pretty Woman you have feelings for I think that's huge additionally another is using your money for something other than a mortgage and I've told you guys about these three things a lot in the past okay having kids getting married getting a mortgage is the three fundamental Staples of modern existence for some reason this is the three that people drill down your neck and probably education and get a good job that's the five if you tick those boxes your parents are going to be delighted but they don't really benefit you in the early days so if you go and have kids you go and get married you go and get yourself a mortgage MoneyWise you're like 70 80% you haven't had time to save up that much money your time is is gone I've explained all this to you guys before in multiple videos so I don't want to go down that route again but it just stops you being able to do other things right so let's say you get married and it cost you like 40 Grand in total with the honeymoon and everything included the ring the ceremony and whatnot let's say you go and get a mortgage and that took 80 grand of your savings away and yeah you've got a house you're on the ladder but it's kind of like a house that you and your go you and your wife agreed to get and it's not really a house that you would have chosen it's not something very sexy or entertaining it's safe it's like we could raise a couple kids here it's safe it's a nice it's a nice house do you know what I mean that sort of  it's boring so already you're down around about what did I say so 120 Grand is gone um and then out to that you have your your first kids and just prepping for that first kids and all the bills that are going to be written off as a guarantee you know over the next let's say let's say you've had that at 26 let's say over like the next nine years that would take you to 35 which is a very young age and a great age the age where I think men are at their ultimate Peak well that you know takes away round about in total if you add it up about quarter of a million you know your life in that scenario is going to be about quar of a million so why couldn't you spend that money on a holiday home because at the end of the day if you spent that on a holiday home and you has it in a place like Marb where Rob obviously has his which people know so I don't think I'm giv any information away there um you know why couldn't you just go out there for like four months of the year when it's cold five six months of the year and then rent it out for all the summer months and just cash in and be picking up money off the back of that but your life looks really cool you're having a fun life you're still going to be able to attract a partner you're probably going to stay in shape cuz you got more time and you're in a hot location you're probably going to have a better more exciting life you're probably going to be able to attract a better woman you're still going to be able to have kids anyway do you see do you see what I mean guys like it's not a problem and you're Pro you're probably going to be making more money because kids don't make you money marriage doesn't make you money which is a flaw they I'll explain that in a second mortgage doesn't make you money okay it's just glorified renting until you sell it it's not it's not as great as people make out it is if you're buying it to rent out there's benefits there but if you're buying it to live in it it's it's not making you any money it's costing you it's not that great um but when it comes to marriage people always say oh married men make more money no women are just more attracted to Mar to rich men so they marry them you know theyve do you see what I mean it's just like it's it doesn't take a rocket science to figure that one out but what I'm saying is is it's a differential of allocation of funds if that even makes sense you can put your money into other things and I want to get this through into so many young guys' heads as early as possible that you don't have to go down that traditional route you can put yourself in a top percentile if you don't go down the orig the original path the boring path go to school get a good job use your money to you know buy a house get woman get a pregnant have a couple kids it's just like you just look like everybody else your life is boring you end up being in the 80 percentile because it's just like well here's all of us together you know you get all the dads at like football games that because they're clones of one another they're all just huddling together like how you getting on yeah the wife's snagging me on bought like that's not a life okay that sucks in my opinion um another example I want to use for you guys is I got this um kind of danam Bill's area and I found it in my own life is he was on about Navy Seals I don't know if you guys have ever seen the clips I might try and include it but he was talking about Navy SEALS or a Navy SEAL friend of his and he said they were at a party and all these girls referred to the guy as the Marine like literally 10 minutes later like because they don't really care don't really have a they don't really understand it they don't really have a you know like they don't really have an invested interest in things like that so you know I'll give you an example if another guy 's house is nicer than yours and he rents that house people don't care if yours is owned there's just little features like this okay so you might be like oh my God my house is owned I'm doing so well for myself I've actually I'm on the property ladder I've got a mortgage there's another guy who's renting a penthouse in Dubai and you're like oh he's wasting his money what an idiot but people don't really care and his life is better and his house is actually nicer so I don't really see the benefit of being the person who's doing it the right way but his life sucks do you see what I mean again it doesn't put you in an upper percentile it just makes you one of one of many I did it with my own platform I thought the whole way through if I keep going and I keep putting money in how many other people will drop out along the way how many other people are even making their own platform to begin with how many platforms exist like people say there load there's not many like let's be honest not many how many cater to men maybe two there's like a history one in mine but nobody's doing what I'm doing so what I'm doing constantly is trying to become the only runner in the game and if you're the only Runner you win so you know everything is a percentage game um this is uh this is quite a Big C this is quite a big thing that I wrote down yesterday uh is pretty much the Crux of the video too and I think the rarest thing right now in human society is a six foot plus multi-millionaire in his 30s who's in shape single no kids and travels often the reason I think that's the rarest thing is because there's look the the rarest thing might be like a billionaire in his 20s but it's just so unachievable uh and then to say something like oh who's also in shape everyone's in shape in their 20s and whatever right but how many guys and the six foot is just kind of a bonus but I'm just saying like this is probably collectively the rarest thing is a 6 foot plus multi-millionaire in 30 he's in shape who's single with no kids and travels often I don't I don't know many if any just top of my head trying to think I don't know if I know any I mean for myself I'm 6 foot plus multimillionaire based on net worth yeah in my 30s yeah in shape yeah single yeah no kids yeah travels often no like I'm about to but I don't do that yet so I think that's probably the rarest thing right and I don't think that's like take away six foot cuz it's it's it's just a silly thing you can't change it but like to be a a multi-millionaire in your 30s who's in shape who's single with no kids and travels often I think only one of them is hard I think becoming the multi-millionaire but you can still have that lifestyle without being a multi-millionaire you can you can do that based on a netw worth so you know in terms of that scale that I showed you with the four pillars kind of the pyramid that I showed you a minute ago if you were to break that one down that's top 0.01% that's so rare and this is what makes you stand out and I'll give you example of how the world's changing on this I I told you I'd just be riffing off the top of my head but this is how the world's changing is in 19 or I tell you what I'll do it the other way around to make it more shocking in today's world 80% of men drive and 70% of women Drive in 1975 70% of men drove and 30% of women how crazy is that we've got let's say there's a room of 100 women in 1975 70 of them would be like he drives oh wow that's impressive whereas in today's era only 30% only 30 of them out of 100 would be like oh he drives and out of those 30 I would say 15 would have a problem maybe more maybe 20 would have a problem with if your car's or not which you know changes the game completely and this is what life has become now it's all a percentages game people have got to stop thinking about it as like an exact figure I've got to earn this much or you know that guy's more handsome than me it's the collective percentages game if you can just put yourself and like I said they do it in sports this is how scouting is done now are you in the to it's the straight seven system but glorified in a much more detailed way if you can be in the top percentiles let's say top five percentiles for multiple things will then collectively you know you are in the top percentage overall which is the best way to live your life okay and I got more examples that aren't dedicated to like dating picking up women that sort of stuff because it's not what I want my channel to be but I know it's an important factor so that's why I mention it but here's some other ones um percentage of men that are over so they I'll set the scene so they believe that the average man weighs about 83 kg Okay so that that means 50% of men are over that obviously and then roughly 10% of men are in good shape so with that being said the men who are over 83 kg 40% of them are just fat that's why they're over there the average man probably is roughly about 70 kg realistically if we're being honest so meaning this means then if we've got 50% left 5% of the men over 83 kg are big and lean which makes them attractive makes them stronger more powerful you know better in a fight situation out of that remaining 5% of men how many are trained to fight I would say less than a percentage and suddenly if you're in that percentage now you're safer than anyone else alive you have free life insurance and less to worry about less problems and more respect you'll get more respect from women and men so just by being over 83 kg and being lean and learning so some level of martial arts whether it be boxing Jiu-Jitsu wrestling whatever it might be you put yourself in a top one percentile the toughest people alive I think that checks out I think in terms of cardio Fitness whatever like physical fitness protecting the home you know somebody tries to punch you in the street you're in the top 1% immediately like why would you why would you not do that it just gives you a much better life you you could walk home at night with headphones in and not have to give a bollocks do you know what I mean like that is such a nice life I would feel comfortable doing that I would feel comfortable doing that big time um I'll give you another example 400 people this is this is fact this happens 400 people showing up to a flat view in New York this happens people are like oh we really want this flat but there were 400 people that showed up to view it like that's nuts you don't want that level of competition the penthouse that I like in London has been sat on that website for two years with no bids I've spoke to them about it I actually went to view it and they said the people didn't want to get out of bed because it was a Saturday morning I was like for 2 million I would get out of bed and I'll clean that place for you and I'll cook you a breakfast do you know what I mean but I guess it's a pair of rich kids or something that have just been handed it they don't really respect him but yeah it's been there for two years with no bids because I'm the only person who that who really fits that criteria a penous in the middle of the City okay who's got the money to do that a decent number of people but out of those people who's got kids ah most of them do you know what I mean cuz they're going to be older so it's like I'm just on my own trying to bid for this place there's some shoes that I wanted I've wanted them for six months there was only one pair left in my size and it was like that for six months and I I see the other day that they've been they've been they're sold out now but 6 months my size they were available the reason being because of the wealth bracket I've put myself in people aren't searching for these type of shoes they're not bidding for these types of shoes now I'm not stupid enough to buy them but I was always looking at them like oh they are nice if I get the opportunity I probably will but I was I'd rather put the money back into the business but the shoes that I want are there they're available it's not like Asos where you get on there and within five minutes it's sold out cuz it's so cheap everyone can afford it do you see what I mean your life just gets better when you increase Rarity and get yourself in an upper percentile um um so one I've written here and this kind of links back to what we said before but it's 3% of people in the UK have a second home how many of these are just boletes likely the majority and some of them are Caravans and stuff like that how many are Holiday Homes and I'm talking like nice Villa in Lisbon or Paris or car that's a top 1% move immediately just by having a house like that it's a top 1% move I've also written that travel is King now it's the one thing that 99% of people can't do more than one or two times per year um having a villa in my bear like Rob for example and the ability to get there quickly makes you so rare and different I couldn't describe it to you I've written picture this you have a home in Paris and one in Marb you live in Fulham London reason being Heath thr is 25 minutes away 38 minutes away from St panras uh you could be in Paris within 3 hours in Marb within 5 and you don't even need to be that rich that's life setup to its finest level now imagine you're in shape and single at 30 and dress really well with a nice car there's just nobody on your level and in total that entire life might cost 3 million with upfront payments of about half a million and two properties to rent out while you're not there that's covering all monthly payments that's a very unique scenario but I came up with it yesterday I was sat around thinking I think a lot of you guys would believe by 50 you would have earned 3 million in total okay so that can be your complete life setup all paid off now that doesn't mean you have to wait till 50 because The Upfront payments would be about 500k to have all of that you can have that lifestyle quite early on do you see what I mean and that's a very that's a top 0.1% lifesty this bridges into life setup now I think a lot of people I think a lot of people are looking at the wrong things I think if you if everything you do in life every decision you make I think if you do do it based on a percentage game and you go how many other people are doing this is this a boring move is this a safe move is this something that doesn't grant me many options is this something that just kind of has me driving the kids to school at at 8:30 a.m. and then you know walking back to my house and then going to a boring job and like do you know what I mean if if everybody's doing it it's not going to make you stand out if everyone's going out drinking on a Saturday night is probably not the move do you see what I mean everything from 30 to 50 is a percentages game and because you have adult money you have to spend it in the right way you have to understand life setup the way I've been talking to you about it um and my last example I was talking about clothes off the rack I was saying Asos top man versus buying one expensive item that will last so Bell star for example there's a 900 coat that I like versus spending £900 on Asos on white te's and crap that will last one season at most and shrink after one wash I've done it I've bought a t-shirt from that it shrinks after one wash you'll significantly Stand Out Among the cookie cutter men today all wearing variants of the same stuff so you can see where my mind was at in this whole video imagine like like I said you spend the same money on one item and everyone else spends it on like 50 items but they all shrink in the wash they all look terrible after one wash they all look terrible after you worn them four or five times um they're not items that you can keep so the next season you're buying them again so it's much better to have that £900 coat that you can stand out in do you see what I'm coming from guys like it's a statement piece it's something that will be like damn this guy's got his life sorted out he's not wearing what everybody here is wearing he doesn't look like somebody straight off love Islands his life is different he has features in his life that a very small percentage of men have so let's say you've got that coat you're in shape you don't have kids you're between 25 and 45 you've got your wealth up to around about 60,000 per year pretty good you know puts yourself in an upper bracket you've been saving that money and instead of getting a mortgage you've just rented in your hometown and it doesn't have to be a baller place you can just keep it like my place is very good it's very nice but it's not expensive it's very easy to run which then frees up money to build a streaming platform if it didn't go into the platform I could have kept going what I've got here with YouTube and the products and whatever and I could have put roughly which is now approaching around about 3 to 400,000 into the platform that could have gone into a holiday home and I could have had this ball of villa which this year I probably do cuz I don't need to put it into the platform anymore in terms of the build so I will probably do that this year it's all doable it's all there it's all a possibility if you don't just go I want a mortgage I want a cookie cut a life I want a wife I want two kids I want to sell it's like that is fine if you're happy I'm never going to tell anybody not to do it in that sense but I'm just I like to remind you guys that there's other options out there it it isn't it isn't the the must do it's an option you don't have to do it you can wait because at the end of the day people say oh but what if I get to like 39 and nobody wants me and I'm lonely if you're a 39y old guy who would know kids who's in shape as I've shown you on here and your wealth level because that's what your focus has been and your life set up and you've got Villas and nice cars and whatnot and you dress better and you've had a skincare routine taking care of yourself you haven't gone out and had 10 beers with the boys every weekend cuz you're pissed off with the misses and the kids your life's going to be amazing and you're going to reflect that you're going to have an internal health of like a 22y old and you're going to look about 28 do you know what I mean you're going to be able to stay on top of it and like I told you guys before there is a bracket as well to just put your minds at ease because I don't want this to be all about women just put put your minds at ease which I don't think it has been but to put your minds at ease here I speak to a lot of women between 25 and 29 and I've told you guys before I feel sorry for them because the guys between that bracket they haven't made it in life yet they haven't sorted their  out the ones that have are out of shape and look really old there's very few guys that are doing well in their 30s who are in shape just that alone is one of the rarest things on planet Earth it's very rare to have that now to have a fun life and good life setup around that because you haven't chosen the cookie cut of Life which you can revisit later on anyway to me it's a no-brainer do you know what I mean it's all there it's on the table you can take that the amount of 27 year old women that are crying out for a 39 year old man who's got his sorted who's still in shape who still looks good who's got a cool life who travels often and wants to take her with him like you're fine do you know what I mean I'm just saying you're fine you don't have to panic everything's great but the focus of this video and what I want you guys to do is focus on getting to that upper percentile in all areas but I want you to make one of these I want you to just draw it on a notepad and just find the percentages and just find four things that you think you could do and just see where it puts you the amount of like faith it gives you in self-improvement and the amount of kind of passion it gives you to keep going and keep pushing forward it just is mind-blowing like looking at that now just to be between 25 and 45 with no kids in shape and to have a decent level of wealth of 60 70,000 a year which is massively doable you know multiple sources of income if you if you really go for it you're in the top0 point 1% just on that criteria right there so what it is guys the great male filter filters everyone out from 25 to 30 based on work rate um you know based on what your focus is and stuff like that and you start showing signs of the guys that have actually put the work in who are going to who are going to make it you know the body starts to change so you can't just keep that fat off anymore you're going to you know you can't have 10 beers on a weekend to keep it off you it's going to start to show on the face you're going to start to be puffy that's stage one stage two is this live setup from 30 to 50 what you do with the money what you're in the great you're doing a great male filter round two you've got adult money what do you choose to do with that adult money you've got you're a little bit smarter you've got more because you got more money you can got more time to do nicer things to make better decisions what are those decisions are you going to have like four kids fair enough if you're happy but then like where's your money going to go you know you're going to settle down with the first pretty girl that finds you handsome at 26 27 you know as soon as you turn 30 you hit this male Advantage stage and you're going to settle down with the first one like you got to make these decisions for you I'm not saying one's right one's wrong I'm just saying like add add up the percentage game and just be like where do I sit am I a cookie cutter do I look like everyone else do I dress like everyone else do I have the same Li life as everyone else have I handcuffed myself with marriage mortgage and kids too early on well you're probably in the 80 percentile you know whereas a guy who's followed a different route he's going to put himself in the top 1% top 0.1% it's not rocket science you just got to add up and this is like it's hard to get into people's heads but it's not he's better looking than me he's got better genetics than me he's luckier than me he's got a better scenario than me this is the point I want to end with here and get across to you guys it's more of a focus on being smart you know are you being smart have you been smart with your money your time your decisions what you've actually invested your focus on you know instead of investing your focus on being a good family man which can come later down the line you know did you invest it into wealth and life setup and then you have everything you know what what did you choose to do like this is your main focus he's more handsome than me yeah but he sucks at everything else oh he's taller than me yeah but he's broke he doesn't have a cool life it like it's just about good decision- making and being smart it's not that hard if you want to put yourself in an upper percentile guys just switch your brains on sit down I encourage you to do this it doesn't have to be four tiers you could do 10 tiers 20 tiers see where it ends up you could even do like a flow diagram draw your way down yes or no okay yes or no yes or no I think that's a flow diagram do it all the way down till you get to the bottom and then you go I might draw one up I might draw a massive one up for people to download and then you can see what percent what percentile that puts you in on each category you know starting at the top age and then whatever and then where you go and then kids and go down all the way to the bottom wealth level where that puts you you will be surprised how easy it is to put yourself in an upper percentile but that's the video guys hope you enjoyed it I'll catch you all soon been a little bit busy guys so haven't been able to film that ad yet but don't forget we've got a bunch of

don't forget to check that out guys and enjoy the video okay guys welcome back to another video uh in this video we're going to have a return of a video that did extremely well which is the great mail filter um I'm going to do a little bit of screen stuff like I used to I'm going to make this like an old school video um just trying to figure out my head how I'm going to do it but I think it's going to be very mixed and matched I think I'm going to be kind of all over the place with this video uh just riffing from one thing to another just kind of talking about different areas and whatnot uh it's the videos that you guys used to love so we'll see how long it goes on for uh but it should be good fun now I just got a couple things to EXP exp I'm going to have to use my phone throughout this so I don't don't forget anything so bear with me but I know a lot of you guys like to go to the gym get on the treadmill and just kind of switch off so this could work perfectly so this is the great mail Filter part two if you would uh 30 to 50 and this is all about percentages now the first video I've done or I did on the great mail filter was regarding 25 to 30 roughly I think I think it was 25 to 30 and uh the kind of basis of that video was that you know you everybody's pretty much the same 18 years old you're all going out you're getting drunk you're enjoying yourself there's not a lot really happening and then certain guys from like 25 to 30 they kind of and look you don't have to do it at 25 you could have been doing it before but if you're going out for example example drinking a lot the signs won't show at 24 you'll still look young in shape healthy handsome whatever and you don't really need money at that point but the guy who's been putting the work in 25 to 30 it's almost like a Chasm it just starts to separate instead of those lines running parallel they go like that they split like a y or a V and I think by 28 29 30 you start to see who the guys who were actually putting the work in so that was the first episode of the great male filter you should go and watch it if you haven't first because it is it is a good one even though I say so myself uh but this one today like I said is 30 to 50 percentages and this is more about once you once you get to 30 I think the game changes so I'm 31 now I've been 31 since the end of August I've made a decent Dent into my 30s and I can see more things going on I can see more science am I sat in the middle here guys it feels like I'm not we'll figure it out um but what I've written down here is Rarity is king so I'm going to read stuff off the phone and then riff off the back of it but Rarity is King you don't have Rarity in your teens and 20s which is what I said earlier you in your teens and 20s pretty much early 20s everybody's the same so you've got no money okay so does everybody apart from when Justin Bieber was young do you know what I mean there's a few athletes and a few pop stars that's about it everyone else is pretty much broke we're all in the same boat in shape there's one or two guys that ended up going to the Jim young but everyone's pretty much leaning in shape you know low body fat it's not that different uh assets not that different cars it might be like one guy who's managed to get a decent car cuz he works for his dad's Building Company and he saved up and got one on finance and he's the first to get one of the German CS do you know what I mean it's but it's the Gap isn't that big is everybody's pretty much the same um and I said in your 30s just being in shape put you ahead of 90% of men and that is why this video is about percentages and even if you are currently in your teens or early 20s I I actually I know it sounds silly because it's almost like you're promoting your own but I do think it's important that you watch this video so that you know the prep work you need to do for what's coming next and like I said if you're just in shape in your 30s especially 40s or 50s it puts you ahead of 90% of guys okay and I'm not just talking about being attractive to women CU that is what 90% And what I used to kind of lean towards of videos are about in this industry you know people people will make a whole video on a whole topic just for how to get late that's what it feels like but when I say just being in shape puts you ahead of 90% of men I mean to protect yourself to look better than other people and that necessarily doesn't have anything to do with attraction that just means you feel good about yourself you're looking at other guys your age and you're going I look good I'm doing well here I like the way I like the way my appearance is you're not getting the same health issues that they are imagine being 44 years old you feel like you're 21 and all the guys your age have got back problems and and big beer bellies you're going to feel mentally better do you know what I mean you're going to look in the mirror and think I feel good you know as a bonus yeah there might be some attraction there might be you know the partner that you can attract is better it's just bonuses on the side they're extras you know that's that's something that we all appreciate but as a holistic lifestyle you feel great you can play with your kids you can still run you go to your kids sports day and you can still do the 100 meters like there's just there's so many benefits it's unreal um and you know what I tell you what I'm going to do one more point and I'm going to jump over to the screen um so for the first time in your 30s as well well you know from 30 onwards and this it's not always the case you get some people who make money earlier but it's for the majority of people probably 99% of young men it when you hit 30 is probably the first time that you've had real money in your life so in terms of the great male filter and this is what I've written here it's not just separating yourself from other men at this point okay when you're 25 to 30 you're separating yourself and you're trying to become I guess just simple form better than do you know what I mean you're just trying to upgrade your video game character quicker than other people that's all it is from 25 to 30 but 30 to 50 because you do have serious adult money for the first time or at least you know you should have more um it's not just about separating yourself from other men but also what you then do with that time and money so an example would be I have a boxing coach an acting coach because obviously I'm going to try and do my own movies I had a leg coach for a little while um you know stuff like cleaners thing like just things like that uh that's more for what you do with your time and in terms of what you do with your money I'm linking back to life setup which is something that you guys love okay so we'll get to that later on but it could be closed so and I'll dive deep into this later on but you know Asos for example I don't know if you have something similar in America but we have Asos in the UK where every guy and their dog gets his clothes and you just look like off the rack normal guy now if that's all you can afford look I'm not mocking anybody that's fair enough but from my Approach and I've always sort of had this is I'd rather save up go and get something like that one statement piece item so you don't just look like a cookie cutter guy you know amongst all the rabble so to speak and we'll get to that point later but what I want to do now hopefully my phone battery holds out let me close it down just in case what I want to do now is jump to the screen uh I got two pictures for you I made these yesterday Art Attack style okay so I've actually missed a bit down here in the bottom right this should say 100% I think it came off when I went back and had to save it again this either way it doesn't matter so down here what I've done is to make it relatable to a lot of you guys is men between 25 and 45 which is a huge bracket of my audience so that would be 100% because as long as you're you don't have to do anything as long as your age between 25 and 45 you're in this bracket okay so that's 100% of you listening right now you're in here and this what I tell you what I've done as well I've made it just four tiers the reason I made it four tiers is to show you it doesn't take a lot to become a high percentage individual to be I don't want to talk about like a high value man and all that stuff because I think that term's over done basically what I'm just trying to get you guys to do with this and with your lives is just be in the upper percentiles you know it's the it's the same in sports you know in scouting okay he's in the top one percentile for like 15 different things let's sign that guy it's the straight seven system that I told you guys before so if you can be a seven in like 50 different areas you're probably going to be like a 10 overall and I'm not talking about attraction again because I don't want to go down that route too much but like in life in general you're Pro probably more likely to get the job you're probably more likely to to not get attacked do you know what I mean if you're just we'll get to this part later too but if you're just a bigger guy you're probably less likely to get attacked if you you know you can protect yourself if you know a certain level of fight Styles and there's just your life overall is just better in all areas like you have certain knowledge of finances you're probably going to have a better life do you know what I mean and this why I only want to use four tiers to show you how quick it can happen so 100% down here up to the second bracket doesn't drink well only 42% of men say that they don't drink and you know what's interesting about that I don't I I don't know on this study but they might have used younger guys as well cuz 42% stands quite High because in terms of all the guys that I see and I know pretty much most drink well to do you know what truth be told I think a lot of guys when they get to 4050 they start trying to cut out the drink so that might be that might be true but if you're 25 and you stop drinking like do you know what that does for your life if you stop partying you go to bed early you stop drinking you go to the gym like if you're doing it before great but if you're 25 you stop doing it by like 30 the Gap is enormous uh and like I said immediately you're in the top and hit like I explained this twice right you're in the top 42% and I'm telling you top 42% because number one it's a good habit so that's why you're there but number two by not drinking the byproduct of that is probably going to be you're leaner you're healthier you look better etc etc etc you guys get what I mean so immediately it just gives you massive benefits better metabolism lower body fat you you have the ability to build more muscle you're going to be better rested better skit do you see what I mean right more money so immediately you're in the top 42% for like 50 different traits which is fantastic then that's going to have an overlap and a knock on effect so it's going to go even further now if you've got more money and you're you know cuz your mindset is different because you're not going out drinking and partying and whatever and you're young you you've decided to work hard and put your money into something else if let's say you're renting a place but you got enough money to get a holiday home and you think you know what renting with a holiday home is better than just having a mortgage here in one country like you know what I've watched Chris a video on M on the Mr International stuff on live setup and framing do you know what I'm going to do it by just having a holiday home and I'm not talking about like a caravan like something decent um I I don't think you'll mind me mentioning because we've put this in a video and I'm I I'll bring it up on our own streaming platform which I you know what is that copyright if I bring up my own own wait who's going to sue me I can't sue myself let's bring this down let's go on to 1 m.
